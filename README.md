# Notes

This is the GitHub repository that hosts my notes, which include:

- The **Notkesto**, my personal [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten)-inspired collection of notes where I write down everything I learn.

- The **Lingokesto**, the collection of notes where I document my linguistics projects.

These notes are currently hosted on [notes.psycake.subspace.club](https://notes.psycake.subspace.club).

Special thanks to [dwrolvink](https://github.com/dwrolvink) for the amazing [obsidian-html](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/) that I use to publish these notes, and to [Jahus](https://jahus.net/) for the `notes.psycake.subspace.club` subdomain.
